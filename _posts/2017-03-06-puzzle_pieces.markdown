There are two main reasons I decided to learn software development, both which are deeply rooted in my everyday life. 
	
I currently work at a publishing as a data analyst. Through my current role I have been exposed to, but barely scratched the service of software development. I have learned how to inspect the page for issues with the sites that I work with, I set up tracking specs with our development team to feed into Google Analytics, and I have used extremely basic syntax expressions to help expedite my work. Although I am thrilled my job has exposed me to the world of software development, I have faced a lot of setbacks and frustrations. There have been countless times where the all male development team at my company has diminished the importance of my work and this has impacted my ability to do my job effectively. For this reason, I wanted to learn software development to prove to myself that I am capable and do not need to rely on others to get the job done. 

The second reason I became interested in software development was learning coding as a second language. Coding is a universal language the reaches around the world. The more aware I am of how much software development impacts our world the more wired my brain has become to think about the software development that occurred behind the scenes. Today when you wake up and grab your phone you may turn off your alarm, check your emails, scroll through Instagram or Snapchat, respond to texts, and eventually put the phone back down. Prior to learning about software development, I wouldnâ€™t have thought twice about the applications I use on a day-to-day basis. Now I think about what script was used to make these applications possible, how does the code vary across the different devices, and countless of other questions. Software development is like a puzzle or a code that I would love to crack.
